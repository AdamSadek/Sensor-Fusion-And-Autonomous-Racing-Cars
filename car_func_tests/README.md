# Testing Car Servo and Motor

Note: Ensure your servo & motor are connected to the **RaspberryPi** and that the **battery** is connected to the ESC (Electric Speed Controller)

Running servo test:
`python3 servo_test.py`

Running servo test:
`python3 motor_test.py`

Some more information about the GPIO pins for input/output. I used the literal board values seen here:

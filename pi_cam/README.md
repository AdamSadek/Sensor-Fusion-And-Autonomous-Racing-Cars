# Camera Setup

1. Depending on what you have setup already, in your on-board machine (RPi), I suggest runningÂ `pi_cam_setup.sh` & `opencv_installation.sh` prior to executing any camera-related tests or programs
2. Once you've installed some necessary packages, go ahead and test both scripts:
  - `camera_snap_test.sh`: Should save an image locally called `test.jpg` with a picture from the camera connected to the pi.
  - `camera_realtime_test.py`: Should display a window frame with a live video from the Pi-Camera.

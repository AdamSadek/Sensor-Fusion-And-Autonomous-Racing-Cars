# Sensor Fusion And Autonomous Racing Cars

This project merges sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to provide racing cars with real-time environmental awareness. This improves decision-making, enabling self-driving cars to precisely navigate tracks and maximize efficiency.

# Software
| Software  | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- 
| Ubuntu 20.04  | Operating System for both the on-board (RPi) and off-board(laptop) machines  |
| ROS2 Foxy  |  Acts as middleware for communication and development |
| Gazebo  |  Realistic environment for testing and simulating sensors used in the racing cars. Also tests racing strategies, decision-making, and algorithms |

# Hardware
| Hardware  | Purpose |
| ------------- |------------- |
| Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB RAM  | Minicomputer to run nodes, scripts, and etc. |
| 20kg Servo Steer  | For steering the car |
| TT-02 Type-S Chassis  | The load-bearing framework of the car |
| Type 540 Torque Tuned Motor  | Motor of the car for it to accelerate |
| Electric Speed Controller (ESC)  | Controls and regulates the speed of the electric motor |
| Enrich Power 3000mah 7.2v  | Battery to power Servo/Motor and more |
| RPi UPS Power  | To power RPi when moving |
| Pi Camera Module v2.1  | Captures images for obstacle detection, lane following, and AI |
| 2D LiDAR  | Scans surroundings, detecting obstacles, navigation support, and path planning |
